    <h4>BLOG</h4>
    <p>This has been my motto since my junior year at Cass Technical High School. I was struggling to understand what my careerpath would be upon graduation and my peers seemed to have it all figured out. I loved writing but i did not see a future in it. I wrote as a perscription for my emotional ailments. In an attempt to heal from the fear of not knowing what career I'd spend the remainder of my life pursuing, I wrote a short poem that began with those words. </p>

    <h4>DEVELOPING</h4>

    <p>Following completion of my Masters of Arts in Public Relations and Organizational Communication at Wayne State University and approximately a decade of communication expereince, I  became a storyteller for entities ranging from large global companies to small start up businesses. Of the accompanying tasks, managing digital presence such as website maintenance and social media strategy were, by far, my favorite. This, along with the necessity to hire tech firms to accomplish certain tasks, led me to my growing passion for computer programming and software engineering.
      <br>
      <br>
    For years, as a communicator working mainly in the automotive industry, I worked alongside engineers and felt like there was a part of me that held a passion for STEM and problem solving. Upon conducting freelance website maintenance and redesign work for a small business, I found myself mining someone else's HTML code on a Squarespace site to find out why my client's map functions were not properly functioning. When I finally found the error, a missing carrot, I felt empowered and knew that coding was my next educational and professional endeavor. In 2016, I found my way to <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/">Grand Circus</a> Detroit for a Front-End development workshop where I learned HTML and CSS. I loved it and was instantly able to use those skills in my role as the sole architect for the internal and external communication infrastructure at Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc. where I was maintaining our recently redesigned website.
    <br>
    <br>
    A year or so later, I found myself working at a global public relations firm in downtown Detroit handling the firm's automotive accounts. We regularly handled their social media strategy and content as well as some campaign support. The client wanted mobile applications to support the cmapaign and my firm partnered with a few freelance developers and tech firms to accomplish tasks like that. Knowing that I had been bitten by the developer bug, I saw an opportunity to make myself more marketable and began searching for a means to broaden my skillset by learning back-end coding. Just when I was about to give up on my search, my mother, who is proficient in Java, told me about a free Java coding program for Detroit residents. When I researched the information further, I found that Grand Circus was hosting the program. With less than a week left to apply, I filled out the application, hoping for the best. Today, I am halfway through my Java coding bootcamp eager to embark on a career in a completely new industry.

  <h4>DETROIT</h4>
  <p>I AM A BORN AND BRED DETROIT NATIVE.
  <br>
  <br>
  My grand parents migrated here from Alabama in the 50s. They met at the infamous Train Station in southwest Detroit and began raising their family in the university district alongside some of their siblings who also moved here for work. From there they moved to other historic neighborhoods including the Boston Edison district, where my mother is currently a proud homeowner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wanting more than to leave one single home to their children, my grandparents moved deeper into Detroit's west side where the purchased a total of about six homes on on block and provide them to their siblings and children to live in. That soon became the norm as many of their neighbors began to do the same. At one point that particular block was chalked full of families who owned at least two homes within that one block. As a result, our neighbors became more like family. Many of my relatives still reside there today.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties my grandparents built for my family serve as the root of my love for the city. I attended THE Cass Tech, home to countless famous and formidable technicians who are world changers today. My very first job was with a small black-owned law firm housed in the Ford building downtown. I earned my Degrees from Wayne State University and purchased my first home in the historic LaSalle Gardens neighborhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit is home to a collection of people full of grit, tenacity, pride and talent. It birthed greatness including Motown Records, some of the nation's first vehicles and the country's first mile of concrete highway. The city turned a bankrupt circus into a zoo--the first to use bar-less exhibits extensively by the way! Ultimately it's people like those represented within the citylimits of Detroit who push the boundaries of our imagination and produce greatness from the absence of basic necessities. I take that spirit with me on every endeavor of my life.
